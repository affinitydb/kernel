 \brief Interface which can be implemented in order to replace or supplement the native kernel i/o

 The AfyDB kernel uses this interface to open, read and change the contents of 
 store data files, log files. and temporary files.  Multiple files can be open at the 
 same time, and the implementation is responsible to track each file with a FD 
 identifier which remains unique and constant as long as the file is open.
 
 To provide an alternative implementation pass it in the StartupParameters structure.
 To profile or supplement the existing kernel implementation use getStoreIO
